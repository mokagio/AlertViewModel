# AlertViewModel

A tiny Swift package with a ViewModel for SwiftUI's [`Alert`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/alert).
Based on the code from [_Test-Driven Development in Swift_](https://tddinswift.com)

ðŸš¨ `Alert` has been deprecated and we should be using [`alert(_:isPresented:presenting:actions:message:)
`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/alert(_:ispresented:presenting:actions:message:)-8584l) instead. This library may or may not migrate to support that new API. _Stay tuned._
